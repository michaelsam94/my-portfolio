faq:
  - q: "What is a modular monolith?"
    a: "A modular monolith is a single deployable application organized into strongly bounded internal modules that communicate through explicit interfaces rather than reaching into each other's internals. You get clear boundaries and independent development without the operational cost of distributed services."
  - q: "Should I start with microservices or a monolith?"
    a: "For most new products, start with a modular monolith. It gives you fast iteration and one thing to deploy while you are still discovering the right boundaries. Extract services later, once a module has proven it needs independent scaling or deployment."
  - q: "When do microservices actually make sense?"
    a: "When you have independent scaling needs, teams large enough that a shared deploy pipeline is a bottleneck, or components with genuinely different reliability and technology requirements. The trigger is organizational and operational scale, not a desire for clean architecture."
---
The modular monolith versus microservices debate finally matured in 2026: the answer for most teams is **start with a modular monolith, extract services when a specific pressure forces you to.** Microservices solve organizational and scaling problems, not code-cleanliness problems — and if you reach for them before you have those problems, you pay the full distributed-systems tax (network failures, eventual consistency, distributed tracing, deployment orchestration) to solve problems you do not yet have. A modular monolith gives you most of the design benefits people *think* they need microservices for, with a fraction of the operational cost.

Let me make that concrete, because "it depends" is not advice.

## What each actually is

A **microservices** architecture splits a system into independently deployable services, each owning its data and communicating over the network. A **modular monolith** is a *single* deployable app, but internally organized into strongly bounded modules that talk through explicit interfaces — not by reaching into each other's tables or internals.

The crucial insight: **modularity and distribution are different axes.** You can have a well-modularized monolith or a big-ball-of-mud monolith; you can have clean microservices or a distributed big ball of mud. People conflate "modular" with "microservices," then adopt distribution to get modularity they could have had for free in one process.

```
Modular monolith                    Microservices
┌───────────────────────────┐       ┌────────┐  ┌────────┐  ┌────────┐
│  one process / deploy      │       │ orders │  │payments│  │catalog │
│ ┌────────┐ ┌────────┐      │       │  +DB   │  │  +DB   │  │  +DB   │
│ │ orders │→│payments│      │       └───┬────┘  └───┬────┘  └───┬────┘
│ └────────┘ └────────┘      │           └── network + contracts ┘
│  in-process calls, 1 DB    │        (independent deploy + scale)
└───────────────────────────┘
```

## The cost you take on with microservices

Distribution is not free. The moment a call crosses the network you inherit:

- **Partial failure.** In-process a method call either returns or throws. Over the network it can time out, half-succeed, or arrive twice — so you need retries, [idempotency keys](https://blog.michaelsam94.com/idempotency-distributed-systems/), and backpressure everywhere.
- **Eventual consistency.** No cross-service transactions. Data spread across service databases means sagas, outbox patterns, and reasoning about intermediate states.
- **Operational surface.** Service discovery, distributed tracing, per-service CI/CD, versioned contracts, and a lot more to monitor.

None of that is prohibitive at the right scale. All of it is pure overhead at the wrong scale.

## When a modular monolith is the right call

- **Early-stage products** where the boundaries are still being discovered. Getting boundaries wrong in a monolith is a refactor; getting them wrong across services is a migration.
- **Small to mid-size teams** that share one deploy pipeline comfortably. If everyone can ship without stepping on each other, you do not need deployment independence yet.
- **Systems where a single transaction is genuinely useful** — an in-process ACID transaction across two modules is trivial; the same across two services is a distributed saga.

The key discipline is enforcing boundaries *inside* the monolith so it does not rot: modules expose interfaces, own their own data (separate schemas or clear table ownership), and depend on each other only through public contracts. Tools and package structure can enforce this — the same [dependency-rule thinking](https://blog.michaelsam94.com/clean-architecture-pragmatically/) that keeps layers honest.

## When microservices earn their keep

Reach for services when you hit a real, specific pressure:

| Trigger | Why microservices help |
| --- | --- |
| Independent scaling | One component (e.g. image processing) needs 10x the resources of the rest |
| Team autonomy at scale | Many teams; shared deploy pipeline has become a bottleneck |
| Divergent reliability needs | Payments needs stricter SLAs/isolation than a recommendations feed |
| Technology heterogeneity | A component genuinely needs a different language or runtime |
| Independent release cadence | One area must ship many times a day without dragging the rest |

Notice these are organizational and operational triggers. "Our code is messy" is not on the list — messy code follows you into microservices and gets harder to fix.

## Build for extraction, not for distribution

The pragmatic move is to build a modular monolith whose modules are clean enough to lift out *when* a trigger appears. That means:

1. **No shared mutable database tables across modules.** Each module owns its data; others read through its interface. This is the single hardest thing to retrofit, so do it from the start.
2. **Communicate through explicit contracts,** not by importing another module's internals. In-process today, over the network tomorrow — same contract.
3. **Async where it will eventually be async.** If two modules will one day be separate services communicating via events, use an in-process event bus or the [outbox pattern](https://blog.michaelsam94.com/event-driven-outbox-pattern/) now, so the extraction changes the transport, not the design.

Get those right and extracting a service later is mechanical: wrap the module's contract in an API, give it its own deployment, point callers at the network. Get them wrong and you have a distributed monolith — services that must deploy together and share a database, which is the worst of both worlds.

## The honest summary

Microservices are a solution to scaling *organizations and load*, and they are excellent at it. They are a terrible solution to "I want clean boundaries," which a modular monolith gives you without the network tax. Start monolithic and modular, keep the boundaries strict, and let genuine operational pressure — not architectural fashion — pull individual services out when the time comes. In 2026, that measured path is what most successful teams actually run. Want a second opinion on whether it is time to split? [Reach out](/#contact).

## Production notes for LLM stacks

When `modular-monoliths-vs-microservices` sits on an inference or RAG path, treat user prompts and retrieved chunks as untrusted input. Log correlation IDs and policy decisions—not raw prompts—in production telemetry. Gate risky operations behind explicit authorization at the gateway, not inside ad-hoc tool handlers.

Roll out changes with shadow mode first: record what **would** have happened under the new rule without blocking traffic. Compare deny rates, latency impact, and false positives for at least one business week before enforcing. Pair enforcement with a runbook entry: symptom, dashboard, rollback (feature flag or config), and owner.

Load-test with production-shaped concurrency. LLM workloads burst differently from CRUD APIs—tail latency and token throttling dominate. If `modular monoliths vs microservices in 2026` protects an invariant (security, billing, data residency), prove the invariant with an automated test that fails CI when someone removes the check.

## What teams get wrong

Teams copy a reference architecture without matching their compliance tier, then discover in audit that logs, backups, or support exports reintroduced the data they thought they had eliminated. Another pattern: shipping the demo integration without idempotency, then fighting duplicate side effects when clients retry on model timeouts.

Document the tradeoff you chose—strictness vs recall, cost vs quality, sync vs async—and the metric that tells you if the choice still holds six months later.
