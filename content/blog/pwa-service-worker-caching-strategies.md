faq:
  - q: "Which caching strategy for hashed static assets?"
    a: "Cache-first. Filenames include content hashes so cached files are immutable until deploy."
  - q: "Should authenticated API responses be cached?"
    a: "Generally no, or cache per-user with strict cache names and short TTL. Shared caches leak personalized data."
  - q: "What is stale-while-revalidate?"
    a: "Serve cached response immediately while fetching fresh data in background to update cache for next visit."

The gap between reading about service worker caching strategies and shipping it in production is where most teams lose weeks. Documentation shows the happy path; production has legacy components, third-party scripts, analytics requirements, and accessibility audits that do not care about your sprint deadline. This post covers what actually works when you own the frontend surface area and need measurable improvement — not a conference demo.

I have applied these patterns across product sites where Core Web Vitals affect SEO, checkout flows where payment UX directly impacts revenue, and auth flows where a confusing MFA step generates support tickets. The recommendations here are biased toward changes you can validate with field data and rollback with a feature flag.

## Strategy per asset class

Before changing implementation details, draw the boundary diagram. Service Worker Caching Strategies touches routing, caching, client state, and often edge middleware. If you cannot name which layer owns the behavior, you will fix symptoms in React components when the problem lives in cache headers or a third-party script.

```
Browser ──▶ CDN / Edge ──▶ App Server ──▶ Data / CMS
   │            │              │
   └── Client UI └── Middleware └── Server Components / API
```

| Layer | Owns | Watch for |
|---|---|---|
| Edge / CDN | Cache, geo routing, security headers | Stale content, cookie scope |
| Server | Data fetching, auth, personalization | TTFB regressions, cache misses |
| Client | Interactivity, optimistic UI, a11y | Bundle size, hydration, INP |
| Third party | Analytics, payments, chat widgets | Long tasks, CSP violations |

Document which metrics you expect to move. If service worker caching strategies is a performance change, baseline LCP, INP, and CLS in CrUX or your RUM tool for affected routes before merging. If it is an accessibility change, run axe and manual screen reader checks on the critical path — not just the component story.

## Cache versioning and cleanup

Start with the smallest change that proves the approach. For service worker caching strategies, that usually means one route, one component tree, or one middleware rule — not a platform-wide migration.

```tsx
// Example: progressive adoption pattern
// Step 1 — isolate behind a feature flag or route segment
export async function Page() {
  const enabled = await flags.isEnabled("pwa_service_worker_caching_strategies");
  if (!enabled) return <LegacyExperience />;
  return <NewExperience />;
}
```

```typescript
// Example: measurable wrapper for RUM
export function reportMetric(name: string, value: number, tags: Record<string, string>) {
  if (typeof window === "undefined") return;
  // Send to your analytics / RUM endpoint
  navigator.sendBeacon?.("/api/rum", JSON.stringify({ name, value, tags, path: location.pathname }));
}
```

Validate in staging with production-like data volumes. Empty caches and synthetic tests lie. Warm the CDN, test logged-in and logged-out states, and exercise the failure paths — slow network, ad blockers, and screen reader navigation.

For TypeScript-heavy codebases, type the boundaries explicitly. Loose `any` at integration points hides regressions until runtime. Prefer `satisfies`, discriminated unions, and schema validation (Zod) at server/client boundaries so malformed CMS or API payloads fail in development, not in a user's checkout flow.

## Avoiding broken offline a11y assets

Performance optimizations that break keyboard navigation or screen reader announcements are net negative. Every change should preserve or improve WCAG 2.2 conformance:

- **Keyboard**: All interactive elements reachable in logical tab order; no focus traps except intentional modals with escape hatches.
- **Focus visibility**: `:focus-visible` styles that meet contrast requirements — do not remove outlines without replacement.
- **Motion**: Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`; provide non-animated alternatives for essential feedback.
- **Live regions**: Loading and error states announced with appropriate `aria-live` politeness — avoid spamming assertive announcements.
- **Target size**: Touch targets at least 24×24 CSS pixels (WCAG 2.2 AA); prefer 44×44 for primary actions on mobile.

Run automated checks (axe-core) on affected routes in CI, then manually test with VoiceOver or NVDA on the primary user journey. Automated tools catch roughly 30–40% of issues; manual testing catches the rest.

## Cache poisoning and scope

Frontend changes intersect security even when the task is "just UI." Any new script source, inline handler, or third-party embed affects your Content Security Policy attack surface. Any new form field may collect PII subject to GDPR retention limits.

- **CSP**: Prefer nonces over `unsafe-inline`; use `strict-dynamic` only with a understood script graph.
- **XSS**: Never `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` without sanitization; treat CMS rich text as untrusted input.
- **CSRF**: Mutating requests need synchronizer tokens or SameSite cookies plus Origin validation.
- **Storage**: Do not persist tokens or PII in `localStorage`; prefer HttpOnly cookies for session identifiers.
- **Consent**: Analytics and marketing tags load only after consent where required — not on first paint.

Review changes with the same rigor as backend PRs. A "small" analytics snippet can exfiltrate form data if misconfigured.

## Testing strategy

Layer tests to match risk:

| Layer | Tooling | Catches |
|---|---|---|
| Unit | Vitest / Jest | Logic, utilities, hooks |
| Component | Testing Library + Storybook | Rendering, a11y roles, interactions |
| E2E | Playwright | Critical paths, real network, visual regressions |
| Performance | Lighthouse CI, WebPageTest | Budget regressions, LCP/CLS lab signals |
| Accessibility | axe-core, pa11y | WCAG violations on static DOM |

Flaky E2E tests erode trust — quarantine and fix, do not mute. Performance budgets should fail PRs on regression, not merely warn.


## Range requests and media

Video/audio range requests need custom strategy — cache-first breaks seeking. Use network-first for `.mp4` or delegate to Media Source Extensions without SW interception.

## Vary header awareness

Responses with `Vary: Authorization` must not share cache entries across users — use cache key plugin including authorization hash or network-only for those URLs.

## opaque response handling

Cross-origin resources without CORS may cache as opaque — 7MB quota impact on mobile. Prefer CORS-enabled CDN for fonts and icons SW caches.

## POST request interception

Never cache POST — some teams accidentally register broad fetch handlers. Explicitly exclude non-GET in SW router first line guard.

## Production rollout notes

Review Cache-Control from origin on every API change — backend team shipping no-store on previously cacheable catalog breaks SW strategy silently. Add contract test between frontend SW config and backend cache headers in CI.
## Stale content user override

Offer pull-to-refresh on stale-while-revalidate views — power users learn to refresh when prices look wrong without clearing entire site data. RUM event on manual refresh after stale display informs cache TTL tuning.

## Closing operational guidance

Document cache strategy per route in frontend ARCHITECTURE.md table — on-call should not read entire sw.js during outage to learn if catalog is SWR or network-first.
